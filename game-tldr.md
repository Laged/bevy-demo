# Star Stream – Game TL;DR

- **Premise**: In a neon Y2K future, human drone commanders battle the Inari Intruders—fox-spirit AIs livestreaming Earth—across orbital hex arenas.
- **Core Loop**: Navigate the hex grid, trigger encounters when factions collide, then watch automated battles resolve via DPS/EHP-driven combat while logging results.
- **Progression**: Spend level-up points on a six-stat hexagonal tech tree (Damage, Attack Speed, Movespeed, Evade, Armor, HP) to chase rock-paper-scissors archetypes and shareable build seeds.
- **Systems Pillars**: Deterministic simulations validate balance, showcase components isolate every mechanic, and structured docs keep logic, UI, and lore in sync for autonomous agents.
- **MVP Goal**: Deliver a playable loop where upgrading the skill tree meaningfully shifts matchup outcomes, providing data and visuals that future LLM agents can extend.
