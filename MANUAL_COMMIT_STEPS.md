# Manual Commit Steps for Bevy 0.17 Integration

The automated script is trying to commit files that are already committed or don't exist. Here are the manual steps to complete the integration:

## Step 1: Check What Actually Changed in Each Worktree

### Graphics Tilemap
```bash
cd /home/laged/Codings/laged/bevy-demo/.worktrees/graphics-tilemap
git status
git diff HEAD
```

If there are changes to commit:
```bash
git add -A  # Add all changes
git commit -m "feat(graphics): add colored arena zones with tilemap system

Implements sprite grid approach with distance-based zones:
- Safe zone (green): center within 300 units
- Danger zone (red): 300-800 units from center
- Neutral zone (gray): beyond 800 units
- ~13,125 tile entities covering 3000x2500 world
- Full headless mode support
- Performance benchmarks (‚â•15k fps maintained)

### UI Widgets
```bash
cd /home/laged/Codings/laged/bevy-demo/.worktrees/ui-widgets
git status
git diff HEAD
```

If there are changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(ui): add headless widgets for pause menu and settings panel

Implements Bevy 0.17 widget primitives:
- Pause menu with Button widgets (resume/quit)
- Settings panel with Sliders (volume, difficulty, particles)
- Full headless mode support (PluginMode::Headless)
- Event-driven updates (PauseMenuToggled, SettingsChanged)
- GameSettings resource for persistent configuration
- Performance baseline maintained (‚â•15k fps)

### UI Viewport
```bash
cd /home/laged/Codings/laged/bevy-demo/.worktrees/ui-viewport
git status
git diff HEAD
```

If there are changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(ui): add minimap using Bevy 0.17 ViewportNode

Implements tactical overview system:
- MinimapCamera (5x zoom out, follows player)
- ViewportNode rendering camera to UI corner (bottom-right)
- Camera position tracking system
- MinimapCameraReady event emission
- Full headless mode support (camera logic, no rendering)
- Performance baseline maintained (‚â•15k fps)

## Step 2: Merge to bevy-0.17-features

```bash
cd /home/laged/Codings/laged/bevy-demo
git checkout bevy-0.17-features

# Merge each branch (skip if nothing was committed)
git merge graphics-tilemap --no-edit
cargo test -- --nocapture  # Verify tests pass

git merge ui-viewport --no-edit
cargo test -- --nocapture

git merge ui-widgets --no-edit
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Step 3: Merge to dev

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge bevy-0.17-features --no-edit
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Step 4: Clean Up

```bash
# Remove worktrees
git worktree remove .worktrees/graphics-tilemap
git worktree remove .worktrees/ui-widgets
git worktree remove .worktrees/ui-viewport

# Delete branches
git branch -d graphics-tilemap
git branch -d ui-widgets
git branch -d ui-viewport
```

## Alternative: Simplified Approach

If no files actually changed (everything was already committed earlier), you can skip the commits and just merge:

```bash
cd /home/laged/Codings/laged/bevy-demo
git checkout bevy-0.17-features

# Check if branches have any commits ahead
git log graphics-tilemap --oneline | head -5
git log ui-widgets --oneline | head -5
git log ui-viewport --oneline | head -5

# If they do have commits, merge them
# If they don't, the branches are already up to date
```

## What Likely Happened

The script output shows:
- ‚úÖ All 5 tilemap tests pass
- ‚úÖ All tests in graphics-tilemap pass
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Git says "nothing added to commit"

This means the test file changes I made (`tests/tilemap_test.rs`) were the only modifications, and they might already be committed. The script was trying to commit source files that don't exist or weren't changed.

Check what the actual state is with `git status` and `git log` in each worktree.
