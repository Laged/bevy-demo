# Content & Roadmap (Tech)

## Release Management
- Content packs tracked via feature flags or Bevy plugin groups.
- Data-driven approach for adding encounters, maps, and narrative beats.
- Versioning strategy for live updates and backward compatibility.

## Pipeline
- Tooling for authoring encounters, world sectors, and broadcast events.
- Validation scripts (linting data files, verifying asset references).
- Build automation (CI jobs for `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `cargo build --release`).

## Future Work
- Tech debt backlog aligned with roadmap milestones.
- Instrumentation for measuring content engagement.
- Guidelines for sunsetting or rotating seasonal content.
