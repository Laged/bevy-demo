# Overview

## Purpose
Capture the soul of Star Streams at a glanceâ€”why the game exists, who it serves, and the non-negotiable pillars that hold every decision accountable.

## Key Pillars
- **Premise**: Drone commanders duel Inari fox-spirits across an orbital hex-field streamed to a Y2K-future audience.
- **Promise**: Deterministic combat that rewards mastery of stats, positioning, and encounter prep rather than twitch skill.
- **Play Cadence**: Bite-sized tactical sorties that feed a longer progression arc through shareable build seeds.

## Deliverables
- One-paragraph elevator pitch and a one-sheet for quick context.
- Target audience, tone adjectives, accessibility goals, and live-ops aspirations.
- Success metrics that future contributors can measure against.

## Open Questions
- What emotions should players cycle through in a 10-minute session?
- Which parts of the fiction are flexible versus canon-locked?
- How does the player base grow season over season?
