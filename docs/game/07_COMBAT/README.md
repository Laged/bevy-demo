# Combat System

## Deterministic Philosophy
- Every battle outcome should be explainable through stats, timing, and positioning.
- Viewer-facing drama without obscuring math.
- Scaling difficulty through informed counter-builds.

## Mechanics
- Stat definitions (Damage, Attack Speed, Movespeed, Evade, Armor, HP).
- Derived metrics (DPS, EHP, Power Level) and how they inform matchmaking.
- Status effects, terrain modifiers, and formation bonuses.

## Encounter Flow
- Initiative order, resolution ticks, and termination conditions.
- Victory rewards, defeat penalties, draw states.
- Broadcast commentary hooks that translate mechanics into story beats.
