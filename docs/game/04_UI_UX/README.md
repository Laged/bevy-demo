# UI & UX

## Philosophy
- Broadcast-first presentationâ€”players feel like producers watching their own show.
- Immediate clarity on combat forecasts, stat deltas, and post-battle analytics.
- Minimal input friction; highlight automation rather than manual micro.

## Surfaces
- Navigation HUD, minimap, and encounter overlays.
- Combat theatre: health bars, DPS meters, status effect callouts.
- Meta layers: loadout manager, skill tree planner, codex.

## Interaction Patterns
- Controller and mouse/key support expectations.
- Accessibility needs (colorblind palettes, narration, input remapping).
- Feedback systems (anticipation, impact, resolution).
