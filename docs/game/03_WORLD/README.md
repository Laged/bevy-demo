# World & Environments

## Spatial Blueprint
- Macro structure of the orbital arena: sectors, control points, traversal hazards.
- Hex tile taxonomy (open space, cover, environmental modifiers, broadcast props).
- Dynamic events that alter the map between encounters.

## Environmental Storytelling
- Visual language for human versus Inari influence.
- Broadcast elements (holo billboards, camera drones) that reinforce the show's spectacle.
- Seasonal variants and how aesthetics shift with tournament stages.

## Encounter Placement
- Rules for spawning objectives, loot pods, and neutral factions.
- Travel pacing, including safe routes versus risky shortcuts.
- Map progression within a single run and across campaign tiers.
