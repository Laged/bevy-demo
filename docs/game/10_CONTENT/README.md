# Content & Roadmap

## Launch Slice

- Content quality bar and acceptance criteria for assets.
- QA checklist for narrative, gameplay, and UX coherence.

## Roadmap
- Post-launch release cadence (seasons, mini-events, expansions).
- Themes for future content drops and how they evolve mechanics.
- Cross-media or community collaborations that feed back into the fiction.

## Documentation Hooks
- Track dependencies on other chapters (lore, progression, economy).
- Identify tooling needs for authoring new encounters or broadcast events.
- Capture retrospective notes to improve the pipeline.
