# Star Streams Game Bible

This index tracks the narrative-first documentation that shapes Star Streams at a technology-agnostic level. Each numbered folder focuses on a pillar of the experience; authors should keep lore, systems intent, and player-facing outcomes here before any implementation details.

## How to Use
- Start in `00_OVERVIEW` for the elevator pitch, pillars, and release cadence.
- Dive into the numbered chapters to develop lore, encounter design, and player fantasies.
- When ready to talk implementation, mirror the same structure in `docs/tech/rs`.
