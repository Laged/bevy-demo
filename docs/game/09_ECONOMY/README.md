# Economy

## Currencies
- Core resources (credits, sponsorship favor, rare components) and how they circulate.
- Earn/spend loops tied to encounter performance and broadcast ratings.
- Soft versus hard caps to prevent hoarding.

## Systems
- Shop inventory cadence, reroll costs, and scarcity knobs.
- Crafting or fusion mechanics for drones and modules.
- Risk/reward levers: gambling mechanics, audience wagers, sponsorship contracts.

## Balancing Guidelines
- Target income per run stage.
- Inflation controls across seasons.
- Player perception levers (fairness, generosity, agency).
