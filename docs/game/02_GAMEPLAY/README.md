- Maintain pacing: short prep, explosive resolution, immediate rewards.

## Design Artifacts

- Encounter difficulty ladders and how they escalate within a run.
- Failure states, retreat options, and comeback mechanics.

## Questions to Answer
- How frequently do new mechanics surface in a single run?
