# Progression

## Goals
- Encourage experimentation with tech tree builds between encounters.
- Deliver meaningful milestones every session.
- Tie advancement to the broadcast metagame (fans, sponsors, ratings).

## Systems
- Hexagonal tech tree structure, unlock cadence, and respec rules.
- Commander level curve and rewards (stats, abilities, cosmetics).
- Narrative progression: chapters, branching paths, rivalries.

## Live Elements
- Seasonal resets or ladders.
- Limited-time events and crossovers.
- Safeguards against power creep while respecting veteran investment.
