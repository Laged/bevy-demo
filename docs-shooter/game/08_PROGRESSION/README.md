# Progression

## Current State
- Runs are self-contained; no meta progression, XP, or unlocks carry over between sessions.
- Player power does not change within a runâ€”no pickups, leveling, or scaling modifiers.

## Session Goals
- Survive longer than previous attempts.
- Use the debug HUD to track personal best enemy counts or FPS drops as informal benchmarks.

## Future Hooks
- Health, speed, and fire rate constants are centralized, making it straightforward to expose them as upgrades later.
- Enemy spawn logic could introduce wave tiers to gate new archetypes.
- Persistent stats (e.g., longest run time) would add purpose to repeated play.
