# Overview

## Elevator Pitch
A minimalist top-down survival shooter built with Bevy. You enter a static arena, kite endless fox-like drones, and try to stay alive as enemy density ramps up every second.

## Player Fantasy
- Pilot an agile drone with a rapid-fire blaster.
- Dodge swarms of enemies closing from all directions.
- Track moment-to-moment pressure via health, enemy counts, and frame rate readouts.

## Session Flow
1. Launch into a single-button main menu.
2. Start a survival run; the player and weapon spawn immediately.
3. Move, aim, and fire while enemies spawn around you.
4. Survive until health reaches zero; the game snaps back to the main menu.

## Pillars
- **Instant Boot**: Zero configuration, straight from menu to combat.
- **Deterministic Controls**: WASD slide movement plus mouse aiming and firing.
- **Escalating Pressure**: Enemies spawn every second with high caps to stress-test performance.
