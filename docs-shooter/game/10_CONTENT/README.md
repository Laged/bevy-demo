# Content & Roadmap

## Launch Slice
- Single survival arena with one player avatar, one weapon, and three visually distinct enemy sprites.
- Decorative props drawn from two atlas tiles.
- Debug HUD and basic main menu round out player-facing content.

## Known Gaps
- No audio, particle effects, or narrative messaging.
- Lack of scoring, achievements, or run summaries.
- Enemy roster does not differentiate behaviour beyond sprite swaps.

## Roadmap Concepts
- Tiered waves introducing new enemy mechanics (ranged, dash, tank).
- Power-up drops or skill tree choices every N seconds survived.
- Boss encounters at timed intervals with unique attack patterns.
- Cosmetic polish: screen shake, hit flashes, VFX, and responsive UI.
