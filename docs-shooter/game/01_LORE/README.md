# Lore

## Current Canon
- No explicit narrative is surfaced in-game; the experience is presented as a pure combat simulation.
- Sprites originate from a chunky sci-fi tileset, implying a robotic protagonist and slime-like hostiles.
- Ambient props (satellite dishes, crates) hint at an abandoned base without providing story context.

## Tone & Mood
- Functional and arcadey: immediate action, no exposition.
- Visual palette leans toward retro pixel art with muted greens and oranges.
- Sound design is absent in the current build, so tension is conveyed purely by visuals and enemy density.

## Opportunities
- Add short flavor lines to the main menu or death screen to establish a fiction.
- Leverage debug HUD real estate for diegetic broadcast chatter or AI commentary.
- Introduce sprite swaps or palette shifts tied to escalating rarity tiers for implied narrative stakes.
