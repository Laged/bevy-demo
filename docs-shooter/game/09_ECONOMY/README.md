# Economy

## Current State
- No currencies, loot, or resource sinks exist.
- Shops, crafting, or reward screens are not implemented.

## Implications
- Every run is mechanically identical; there are no long-term goals tied to accumulation.
- Balancing focuses exclusively on moment-to-moment combat pressure.

## Expansion Ideas
- Introduce scrap or energy drops to incentivize aggressive play.
- Add post-wave vendors for health refills or temporary buffs.
- Track score multipliers based on survival time or kill streaks to create leaderboard hooks.
